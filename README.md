    * run holochain installation script
  * run the global clutter
    * connect with everyone
    * play some kind of game
  * create a workspace cloning clutter
    * get the UUID for this hackathon, insert it into the dna.json file
    * run that holochain app
    * connect with everyone
  * open hc-scaffold
    * videos?
    * create some kind of basic app
    * use hcdev init --scaffold (package?) to create the app from the scaffold data
      * there is an issue here about.. when you have added validation code, what happens to that data? Is nico sorting that out?
    * what are we going to do about the interface? can we make a basic simple interface? That lets you pick an entry type and fill it in and submit it?
