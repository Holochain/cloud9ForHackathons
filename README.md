# Welcome! to Holochain Hackathons on Cloud9
* Either you are at the venue, or hooking in remotely. You can share coding sessions with your group, or easily set up independent spaces
  * Create an account on [Cloud9](https://docs.c9.io/docs/)
  * Create yourself a workspace:
    * We ask you to keep the workspace name simple, with no hyphens or other clever characters
    * paste in the clone URL of this repo
      * https://github.com/Holochain/cloud9ForHackathons.git
    * choose the "blank" workspace type

    * if you are logged into cloud9, this link should take you to the Create Workspace page

To support rapid development during the hackathons, we have created this flow:
* get yourself access to a [cloud9 Collaborative Programming](https://ide.c9.io/dayzee/holohacker) clone of a base holochain set up.
  * Cloud9 is a web based tool, and should run fine on any modern browser.
  
* Go through the instructions [here](someLink) and set-up and run your first Holochain App: "Clutter"
  * Clutter is a purely distributed, twitter clone.
  * Once the instance is running, navigate
